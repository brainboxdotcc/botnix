=============================================

0.0.1 alpha FAQ
---------------

Q: Can i have more than one logging module at a time?
A: Yes, why not? :-) Remember to configure all the modules you use.

Q: Does the DCC module depend on the CTCP module, with DCC technically being a CTCP?
A: No, we decided that this would be a somewhat pointless and annoying dependency.

Q: Why Perl?
A: Because we felt like it. No, really... Perl is a text processing language, and IRC
   is essentially just text. Compared to high level languages like C and object languages
   like Python, Perl is able to process IRC text in a much more efficient manner, plus
   its support for regexps and its portability are second to none.

Q: Can i link my botnix bots together?
A: Not *yet*.

Q: Are passwords case sensitive?
A: Yes.
