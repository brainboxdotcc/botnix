## How to contribute to Sporks

#### **Reporting Bugs**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in Sporks**, and instead [join the official discord](https://discord.gg/brainbox) and send a DM to Brain#0001. These issues should be kept private until resolved.
* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/braindigitalis/botnix-discord-cpp/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/braindigitalis/botnix-discord-cpp/issues/new).
Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** demonstrating the expected
behavior that is not occurring in the event that your bug is in the javascript system.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
* You should ensure that your patch passes the CircleCI build checks and that it runs and operates as expected using a valid discord bot token.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

These patches may be accepted on a case by case basis, or merged in alongside other changes.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [official discord](https://discord.gg/brainbox) and start writing code.
* As you are writing code, you can add a pull request to the project.
* Ensure your pull request's changes are isolated to their own branch
* Pull requests should be mergeable against **master**.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use **Sporks** or how it works in the [official discord](https://discord.gg/brainbox).

#### **Do you want to contribute to the documentation?**

* Simply make a fork of the wiki, make your changes and submit a pull request. We will merge in any changes that enhance the documentation of the project.

Thanks, and have fun! :robot:
