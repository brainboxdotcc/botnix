# Sporks Code of Conduct for Developers

The code of conduct for this project is short and simple and a breath of fresh air.

Our pledge to each other can be summarised as:

1) All developers pledge not to not deliberately harass, troll each other, etc.
2) We pledge to follow the discord terms of service with all code committed to this project repository.
3) Development of this project is a meritocracy and all **good code** is welcomed.

The most important rule of all is to enjoy contributing. If you aren't enjoying it, you're doing it wrong.
